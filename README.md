# Overview
As a software engineer, I'm always looking to improve my skills and push the boundaries of what's possible with code. In this project, I set out to create a visually striking and interactive motorcycle wheel animation using HTML and CSS. My goal was to demonstrate my understanding of CSS animations and styling, while also creating a engaging and dynamic user experience.
The software is a simple yet impressive motorcycle wheel animation that showcases my ability to create complex animations using CSS keyframes and transforms. The wheel spins, giving the illusion of movement and energy.
