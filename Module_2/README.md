# Calculator in Erlang
======================
Overview
--------

As a software engineer, I'm always looking to expand my skills and knowledge in different programming languages. In this project, I aimed to demonstrate my understanding of the Erlang language by building a simple calculator application. This project allowed me to dive deeper into Erlang's syntax, concurrency model, and functional programming principles.

The calculator software I wrote is a command-line application that takes in mathematical expressions as input and evaluates them to produce the correct result. The purpose of this software is to showcase Erlang's ability to handle concurrent requests and its concise syntax for expressing complex logic.

Development Environment
----------------------

To develop this software, I used the following tools:

* Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as my code editor
* Erlang/OTP 23.2 as my programming language
* Rebar3 as my build tool
* The Erlang shell for testing and debugging

Useful Websites
--------------

The following websites were instrumental in helping me complete this project:

* [Erlang Documentation](https://erlang.org/doc/)
* [Learn You Some Erlang](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/)
* [Rebar3 Documentation](https://rebar3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Future Work
------------

Here are some areas I'd like to improve or add to in the future:

* Implement more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., trigonometry, exponentiation)
* Add support for variables and memory storage
* Improve error handling and input validation
* Explore using Erlang's concurrency features to parallelize calculations
