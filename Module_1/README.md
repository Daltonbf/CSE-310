# Overview

As a software engineer, I aimed to create a comprehensive application that showcases my understanding of JavaScript syntax and its capabilities. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a functional application that integrates various features and libraries.

The software I wrote is a [briefly describe the application and its features]. My purpose for writing this software was to further my learning in JavaScript and to explore its applications in real-world scenarios.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used Visual Studio Code as my integrated development environment (IDE). I also utilized the Node.js runtime environment to execute my JavaScript code.

I wrote the software in JavaScript, leveraging its built-in features and syntax. Additionally, I incorporated third-party libraries such as [list libraries used, e.g., Express.js, jQuery, etc.] to enhance the application's functionality.
